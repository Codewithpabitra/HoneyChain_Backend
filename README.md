# HoneyChain

> **Smart India Hackathon 2026 Prototype**  
> AI & IoT-based Honeybee Monitoring and Ethereum Sepolia Blockchain Honey Traceability

HoneyChain bridges the gap between rural beekeepers and modern consumers. The system integrates IoT hive sensors for real-time bee colony health monitoring, AI microservices for predictive colony diagnostics, and the **Ethereum Sepolia** blockchain for immutable, tamper-resistant honey batch provenance and anti-adulteration verification.

## Subsystem Responsibilities

### 1. `backend/` (Operational Core)
- **REST APIs**: Serves client requests from web portals and mobile apps.
- **MQTT Ingestion**: Receives telemetry streams from ESP32 apiary gateways.
- **Operational Database (MongoDB)**: Stores high-frequency sensor readings, hive telemetry, user authentication, apiary records, and laboratory report files.
- **AI Integration**: Coordinates with external ML models for colony stress detection, disease warning, and honey yield forecasting.
- **Blockchain Client (`ethers.js`)**: Securely interfaces with Ethereum Sepolia to register batches, record custody updates, attest lab certifications, and query event logs for verification.

### 2. `blockchain/` (Immutable Provenance Ledger)
- **Network**: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID `11155111`, Gas token `Sepolia ETH`).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Enforces strict authorization directly on-chain for `ADMIN`, `BEEKEEPER`, `LABORATORY`, `PROCESSOR`, `DISTRIBUTOR`, and `AUDITOR`.
- **Minimal On-Chain Footprint**: Stores only cryptographic anchors (metadata SHA-256 hashes, lab certificate hashes, custodian addresses, quality grades, batch status). Does **not** store raw telemetry or binary documents.
- **Event-Driven Auditability**: Emits indexed events (`BatchRegistered`, `BatchCertified`, `CustodyTransferred`, `BatchRecalled`) allowing instant reconstruction of a honey batch journey via Sepolia RPC.

### 3. `docs/` (System Truth & Specifications)
- Centralized, version-controlled documentation repository.
- Contains system architecture diagrams, ADRs, developer setup steps, and progress changelogs.

## Communication: Backend ↔ Blockchain

The Express backend connects to Ethereum Sepolia using **`ethers.js` (v6)** over standard JSON-RPC:
- **Write Operations (Transactions)**: Backend loads role-specific server-side private keys (e.g. Beekeeper wallet for batch registration, Laboratory wallet for certification), estimates gas, signs transactions, and broadcasts to Ethereum Sepolia. Transaction hashes and block confirmations are recorded in MongoDB.
- **Read Operations (Event Filtering & Verification)**: When a consumer scans a QR code, the backend queries the contract view method `getBatch()` and filters historical EVM event logs (`queryFilter`) to build the chronological lifecycle timeline directly from the blockchain.

---

## Security & Secrets Management

- **Isolated `.env` Files**: Secrets are stored in subsystem-specific `.env` files (`backend/.env` and `blockchain/.env`).
- **Strict `.gitignore`**: All `.env` files, private keys (`*.key`, `*.pem`), and build outputs (`artifacts/`, `cache/`, `dist/`) are strictly ignored by Git. Only template `.env.example` files are committed.
- **Server-Side Key Isolation**: Private keys are restricted to server-side memory, never logged, and never returned across API endpoints to frontend clients.
- **Testnet-Only Wallets**: Development uses dedicated Ethereum Sepolia testnet wallets with zero real-world monetary value.
